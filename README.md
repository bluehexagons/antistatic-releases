Release Builds of Antistatic

Initially, this repository will only contain release builds of Antistatic.
The JavaScript has been compiled from TypeScript, and the original C source is not included.

I'm working to improve the source code to where it can be included as well.

Currently, Antistatic's source code is still mostly proprietary.

See the readme.md inside of a release for instructions on playing, if needed.

Pull requests are appreciated, and may be ported and incorporated into the proprietary codebase.
Contributions will be noted in-game and in a contributors file.
