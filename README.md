Release Builds of Antistatic

Initially, this repository will only contain release builds of Antistatic.
The JavaScript has been compiled from TypeScript, and the original C source is not included.

I'm working to improve the source code to where it can be included as well.

Currently, Antistatic's source code is still mostly proprietary.

# Use

A full release copy of Antistatic is available in the `/current` directory.

An archive of the current release and older releases are included under the `archives` directory.
